This zip file contains the source files for Java 7 for Absolute Beginners.

If you have the book (I hope so, or these files won't mean much), then you'll
notice that the names of the classes in this zip don't always match the names
of the classes in the book. For example, the book presents four (each
slightly different) Hello classes. In Java, it's illegal to have four classes
with the same name in the same package, so I renamed three of the Hello
classes. I had to do the same in other places as well, but the Hello classes
are the worst offender. The names are pretty obvious, so you probably won't
have any trouble matching the code presented here to the code presented in
the book.
